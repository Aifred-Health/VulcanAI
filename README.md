# Vulcan
Deep Learning Framework

Vulcan is a high-level framework built on top of Pytorch using added functionality from Scikit-learn to provide all of the tools needed for:

* visualizing high-dimensional data
* data preprocessing
* creating modular neural networks 
* model evaluation

This framework was designed with both modularity and ease of use in mind so prototyping architectures is very simple and using them across many machines is even easier. Moreover, it comes with state of the art activations, ensemble methods and network interpretability techniques that all take part in finding the right model for a set of data.

For a more detailed runthrough on how to use the tools, please look at the [wiki](https://github.com/rfratila/Vulcan/wiki)

## Installation
It can be installed using PyPI:
```
<sudo> pip install vulcanai
```
